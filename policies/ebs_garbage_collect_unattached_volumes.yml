    The following EBS EBS volumes will be deleted in 3 days
    If your volume is attached to an instance before 3 days passes, 
    it will no longer be marked for deletion.
    Volumes set to not delete on instance termination do have
    valid use cases as data drives, but 99% of the time they
    appear to be just garbage creation. See your unattached volumes below:
